  <h1>Managing People</h1>
<h2>What makes a good manager</h2>
<h3>Steve Jobs: great individual contributors are best managers</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QplyFXgIx7Q">Youtube Link</a></p>
<p>Professional Managers don't know how to get stuff done. Great inidividula contributors that never wanted to be managers but know nobody will do the job as good as they'll do are the better option.</p>
<h2>Working with unperforming peers</h2>
<p><a href="https://lethain.com/hard-to-work-with/">Will Larson</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a truism that you always want to hire folks with very high standards, but I’ve seen a staggering number of folks fail in an organization primarily because they want to hold others to a higher standard than their organization’s management is willing to enforce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning: If you work with a peer that does perform poorly, you cannot just force your way to them raising their standards, especially if your manager is not willing to enforce higher standards.</p>
<p>If you report the issue to the manager that's unwilling to enforce higher standards, often times a performance issue will be spun into a relationship issue</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] it’s not that the peer isn’t performing, it’s just that the two of you don’t like each other. Instead of being the manager’s responsibility to resolve the performance issue, it’s now the main character’s responsibility. By attempting to drive accountability in their peer, the main character has blocked their own progress (“they’re just hard to work with”) without accomplishing anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often times, that is because the manager is already aware of the issue and for some reason are unwilling to confront it. Reporting it is you trying to hold the manager accountable for for not solving a know problem, which will likely go poorly.</p>
<p>Better approach: Generate excitement in the direction you want to go. This might feel bad because it shouldn't be you job, but life is unfair.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Success is finding a path forward among the options that actually exist.</p>
