  <h1>A philosophy of Software Design - Chapter 8 - Pull Complexity Downwards</h1>
<p>It is more important for a module to have a simple interface than a simple implementation. Reason: most modules have more users than developers, so it's better for the latter to suffer.</p>
<p>If there is some sort of unavoidable complexity, it's better to to hide it from the interface, i.e. pull it downwards.</p>
<p>Configuration parameters are an example of movin complexity upwards: Instead of dealing with a complicated issue internally, the class passes this responsiblity on to the caller.</p>
<p>One should only pull complexity into a class or module that is directly related to this class or module in order to not introduce knowledge into it that should live in another domain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When developing a module, look for opportunities to take a little bit of extra suffering upon yourself in order to reduce the suffering of your users.</p>
